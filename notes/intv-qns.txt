primitive vs non-primitive data types

— primitive - immutable

let name = "Rizwan";

console.log(name); // Rizwan


name[0] = "r";

console.log(name); // Rizwan


name = name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1); // Correct


— primitive - can reassign


let name = "Rizwan";

console.log(name); // Rizwan


name = "rizwan ashiq";

console.log(name); // rizwan ashiq


— non primitive - not same since diff memory location

const persons = ["Rizwan", "Ashiq"];

const persons2 = ["Rizwan", "Ashiq"];


persons === persons2; // false
